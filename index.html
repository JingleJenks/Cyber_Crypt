            <h1>COMMON USE-CASES FOR USING BACKUP SOFTWARE</h1>
            <img src="backup.jpg" alt="backup and keyboard">
            <h2>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BACKUP</h2>
            <p>
                Whether it’s photos, documents, video files, or confidential information, your data is of the utmost
                importance to protect.

                Losing any amount of data can compromise your personal identity, erase your family history, and even
                bankrupt your entire company. No matter if you store years of highly sensitive customer data or just
                save a lot of photos of your dog, you never want to find out that a large chunk or even all of your data
                is gone.
                Most of us are familiar with some everyday backup options such as a</p>
            <ul class="devices">
                <li><img src="USB.svg" alt="usb svg">usb</li>
                <li><img src="exhd.svg" alt="external hard drive">external hard drive</li>
                <li><img src="cloud.svg" alt="cloud svg">cloud services</li>
            </ul>

            <p>And although these products did serve us relatively well, I know all of us have had our issues, whether
                it'd be leaving the usb stick at home or struggling to figure out what you have copied into the cloud
                only to permantely delete from your laptop before its too late!</p>
            <p> This is where <span class=orange>backup software</span> comes in to save the day.
            </p>
            <h2>DO I NEED TO BACKUP?</h2>
            <h3>YES OF COURSE!</h3>
            <p>Backup software offers protection for business data by copying data.
                This data can come from servers, databases, desktops, laptops, and other devices in case of user error,
                corrupt files, or a physical disaster that renders critical data inaccessible.

                It can also protect sensitive business data in the event of a hardware malfunction, hacker penetration,
                and many other threats posed to digitally stored information by running a risk analysis.</p>

                Although backing up your information onto a cloud storage area is the most common way to do so,
                on-premise servers and hard drives are just as capable. It's also important to note that multiple copies
                of backups can be saved. This can be done by retaining multiple points at once, or by saving the same
                backup on multiple drives or clouds.

            <p>The first rule of doing work is “do it right the first time.” If you suffer a minor failure and don’t
                have backups, you may be able to recover certain things, but you never know what those “certain things”
                will be. In almost any case, you’ll have a boat-load of work to redo whether it’s setting systems up all
                over again or recreating spreadsheets you or your employees have been working on for months. Worse yet,
                if you suffer a major data loss, you could feasibly end up re-doing everything you’ve ever done—that’s a
                situation few companies survive.</p>

            <h2>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE?</h2>
            <p>There are many different types of data backup and backup strategies that are each designed to tackle
                different issues, vulnerabilities, and storage needs. Continuous backup is essential to keeping your
                business safe, but it can be difficult to know which type of backup you need to perform.

                You first have to assess how much data you have, the capabilities of your network, and what you want the
                backup to achieve. Only then will you be able to discover the right type of backup for you.</p>
