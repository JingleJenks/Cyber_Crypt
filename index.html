        <p>
            Whether it’s photos, documents, video files, or confidential information, your data is of the utmost
            importance to protect.

            Losing any amount of data can compromise your personal identity, erase your family history, and even
            bankrupt your entire company. No matter if you store years of highly sensitive customer data or just
            save a lot of photos of your dog, you never want to find out that a large chunk or even all of your data
            is gone.
            Most of us are familiar with some everyday backup options such as a</p>
        <ul class="devices">
            <li><img src="USB.svg" alt="usb svg">usb</li>

            <li><img src="cloud.svg" alt="cloud svg">cloud services</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And although these products did serve us relatively well, I know all of us have had our issues, whether
            it'd be leaving the usb stick at home or struggling to figure out what you have copied into the cloud
            only to permantely delete from your laptop before its too late!</p>
        <p> This is where <span class=orange>backup software</span> comes in to save the day.

        <h3>YES OF COURSE!</h3>
        <p>Backup software offers protection for business data by copying data.
            This data can come from servers, databases, desktops, laptops, and other devices in case of user error,
            corrupt files, or a physical disaster that renders critical data inaccessible.

            It can also protect sensitive business data in the event of a hardware malfunction, hacker penetration,
            and many other threats posed to digitally stored information by running a risk analysis.</p>

            Although backing up your information onto a cloud storage area is the most common way to do so,
            on-premise servers and hard drives are just as capable. It's also important to note that multiple copies
            of backups can be saved. This can be done by retaining multiple points at once, or by saving the same
            backup on multiple drives or clouds.

            <p>"Many, if not most businesses are required to keep business records for an extended period. This is
                either
                for tax purposes or because of various regulations. You might just need to look at what was going on a
                few years ago. It’s easy to assume that your computers have you covered just because they’ve got your
                last few years’ worth of information on them. But as you might know by now, having one copy is generally
                a huge mistake. Insuring that you’ve got an offsite backup of critical client information can really
                save you if something goes wrong locally." Anders Anderson Business APS</p>

            <p>"Human hands are very
                capable of destroying a business through silly mistakes or oversights. Don’t think Mother Nature is
                always responsible. Simply backing up data and having an effective backup and disaster recovery plan in
                place can help mitigate these types of threat. You can be one of the surviving businesses if you think
                ahead.." Anders Anderson Business APS</p>

                For large organizations like ours, the average cost of downtime per hour can be as high as 7,000dkk.

            <p>"People are not infallible. They make mistakes, and actually, they make them quite often. Emails
                containing viruses are accidentally opened every day and important files are often mistakenly deleted.
                There’s no reason to fear these issues if you take frequent incremental snapshots of your systems. You
                can simply restore to a snapshot taken before the virus happened. Or you can recover the file from a
                time before it was deleted. Cybercrypt protects our business from the little things and of course are
                ready for the big things as well." Anders Anderson Business APS"
